# http

Deno's standard HTTP server is based on the
[blazing fast native http API](https://deno.land/manual/runtime/http_server_apis#http-server-apis).

## Minimal Server

Run this file in your terminal with `--allow-net` and try requesting `http://localhost:8000`:

```ts
import { listenAndServe } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";

await listenAndServe(":8000", () => new Response("Hello World"));
```

## Handling Requests

`listenAndServe` expects a `Handler`, which is a function that receives an
[`HttpRequest`](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/http/mod.ts#HttpRequest)
and returns a [`Response`](https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Response):

```typescript
export type Handler = (request: HttpRequest) => Response | Promise<Response>;
```

`std/http` follows web standards, specifically parts of the Fetch API.\
`HttpRequest` is an extension of the
[`Request` web standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request),
adding connection information and some helper functions to make it more
convenient to use on servers. The expected return value follows the same Fetch
standard and is expected to be a
[`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response).

Here is an example handler that echoes the request body:

```typescript
const handle: Handler = (req) => {
  return new Response(
    req.body,
    { status: 200 },
  );
};
```

## HTTP Status Codes and Methods

The `Status` and `Method` enums offer helper constants for standard HTTP status
codes and methods:

```ts
import {
  Handler,
  listenAndServe,
  Method,
  Status,
} from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";

const handle: Handler = (req) => {
  if (req.method !== Method.Get) {
    // Will respond with an empty 404
    return new Reponse(null, { status: Status.NotFound });
  }

  return new Response("Hello!");
};

await listenAndServe(":8000", handle);
```

## Middleware

Middleware is a common pattern to include recurring logic done on requests and
responses like deserialization, compression, validation, CORS etc.

A middleware is a special kind of `Handler` that can pass control on to a next
handler during its flow, allowing it to only solve a specific part of handling
the request without needing to know about the rest. The next handler can be
also be middleware, this allows to build chains like this:

```
Request ----------------------------------------->

log - authenticate - parseJson - validate - handle

<-----------------------------------------Response
```

Middleware is just a handler that **can** call the next handler to pass on
control.\
Middleware will sometimes be used to ensure that some condition is met
before passing the request on (e.g. authentication, validation), to pre-process
requests in some way to make handling them simpler and less repetitive
(deserialization, database preloading) or to format responses in some way (CORS,
compression).

`std/http` has a simple, yet powerful, strongly typed middleware system:

### Using Middleware

To chain middleware, use the `chain()` function:

```typescript
import { chain } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";
import { auth, cors } from "./my_middleware.ts";

function sayHello() {
  return new Response("Hello");
}

const handler = chain(auth)
  .add(cors)
  .add(sayHello);

await listenAndServe(":8000", handler);
```

This will pass requests through `auth`, which passes on to `cors`, which passes
them on to `sayHello`, with the response from `sayHello` taking the reverse way.

A chain is itself just a middleware again, so you can pass around and nest
chains as much as you like. This (nonsensical) example does the exact same as
the one above:

```typescript
import { chain } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";
import { auth, cors } from "./my_middleware.ts";

function sayHello() {
  return new Response("Hello");
}

const core = chain(cors)
  .add(sayHello);

const handler = chain(auth)
  .add(core);

await listenAndServe(":8000", handler);
```

### Request Context

Request context is a way to pass additional data between middlewares. Each
`HttpRequest` has an attached `context` object. Arbitrary properties with
arbitrary data can be added to the context via the `.addContext()` method.

Contexts are very strictly typed to prevent runtime errors due to missing
context data.

### Writing Middleware

Writing a middleware is the same as writing a `Handler`, except that it gets
passed an additional argument - the rest of the chain, which should be
called to pass control on. Canonically, that parameter is called `next`.

To write middleware in typescript, there are two things to decide upfront:

1. Does your middleware depend on any specific context data of previous
   middleware?
2. Does your middleware add any data to the context for its following middleware
   to consume?

If the answer to both of these questions is no:
Write a function using the `Middleware` type, which takes the two points above as
optional type arguments, defaulting to the `EmptyContext` (which
is an empty object). A simple middleware that logs requests could be written
like this:

```typescript
import { Middleware } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";

export const log: Middleware = async (req, next) => {
  const start = performance.now();
  const res = await next(req);
  const duration = performance.now() - start;

  console.log(
    `${req.method} ${req.url} - ${res.status}, ${duration.toFixed(1)}ms`,
  );

  return res;
};
```

Note that because we neither depend on any context data nor add any ourselves,
we can use the bare `Middleware` type here, which is short for
`Middleware<EmptyContext, EmptyContext>`, meaning we depend on the empty context
and add nothing.

If the answer is yes:
A middleware that ensures the incoming payload is yaml and parses it into the
request context as `data` for following middleware to consume could be written
like this:

```typescript
import {
  EmptyContext,
  Middleware,
} from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";
import { parse } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/encoding/yaml.ts";

export const yaml: Middleware<EmptyContext, { data: unknown }> = async (
  req,
  next,
) => {
  const rawBody = await req.text();
  const data = parse(rawBody);
  const newReq = req.addContext({ data });

  return await next(newReq);
};
```

The Typescript compiler will make sure that you actually pass the `data` context
that you decided onto the `next()` handler.

Let's write a middleware that will later depend on that `data` property,
validating that it is a list of strings. Note that we also change the context
here, overriding the `data` property to be `string[]` after this middleware
instead of `unknown`, which will allow following code to work with it safely:

```typescript
import { Middleware } from "../../../middleware.ts";

export const validate: Middleware<{ data: unknown }, { data: string[] }> = (
  req,
  next,
) => {
  const { data } = req.context;

  if (Array.isArray(data) && data.every((it) => typeof it === "string")) {
    const newReq = req.addContext({
      data: data as string[],
    });

    return next(newReq);
  }

  return new Response(
    "Invalid input, expected an array of string",
    { status: 422 },
  );
};
```

Without explicitly declaring in the `Middleware` type that you depend on a
certain piece of context data, Typescript will not let you access it on the
actual request context object.

### Chain Type Safety

Middleware chains built with the `chain()` function are type safe and
order-aware regarding request context, even for arbitrary nesting.

This means that Typescript will error if you try to use a chain as a handler for
e.g. `listenAndServe` if that chain does not satisfy all its internal context
requirements itself in the right order. An example using the two middleares we
wrote above:

```typescript
const handle: Handler<{ data: string[] }> = (req) => {
  const { data } = req.context;

  return new Response(
    data
      .map((it) => `Hello ${it}!`)
      .join("\n"),
  );
};
```

This will not pass the type checker:

```typescript
const handleStringArray = chain(validate)
  .add(yaml)
  .add(handle);

await listenAndServe(":8000", handleStringArray);
```

But this will:

```typescript
const handleStringArray = chain(yaml)
  .add(validate)
  .add(handle);

await listenAndServe(":8000", handleStringArray);
```

## File Server

There is a small server that serves files from the folder it is running in using
this module:

```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-read https://deno.land/std/http/file_server.ts
> HTTP server listening on http://localhost:4507/
```

## Cookies

The module exports some helpers to read and write cookies:

### getCookies

`getCookies` reads cookies from a given `Headers` object:

```ts
import { getCookies } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";

const headers = new Headers();
headers.set("Cookie", "full=of; tasty=chocolate");

const cookies = getCookies(headers);
console.log(cookies); // { full: "of", tasty: "chocolate" }
```

### setCookie

`setCookie` will set a cookie on a given `Headers` object:

```ts
import {
  Cookie,
  setCookie,
} from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/mod.ts";

const headers = new Headers();
const cookie: Cookie = { name: "Space", value: "Cat" };
setCookie(headers, cookie);

const cookieHeader = headers.get("set-cookie");
console.log(cookieHeader); // Space=Cat
```

### deleteCookie

`deleteCookie` will delete a cookie on a given `Headers` object:

> Note: Deleting a `Cookie` will set its expiration date before now. Forcing the
> browser to delete it.

```ts
import { deleteCookie } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/cookie.ts";

const headers = new Headers();
deleteCookie(headers, "deno");

const cookieHeader = headers.get("set-cookie");
console.log(cookieHeader); // deno=; Expires=Thus, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
```

> Note: It is possible to pass the exact same path and domain attributes that
> were used to set the cookie.

```ts
import { deleteCookie } from "https://deno.land/std@$STD_VERSION/http/cookie.ts";

const headers = new Headers();
deleteCookie(headers, "deno", { path: "/", domain: "deno.land" });
```

> Note: At the moment multiple `Set-Cookie` in a `Response` is not handled.
